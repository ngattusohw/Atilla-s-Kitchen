            <p>Make sure to follow all of these guidelines and stay safe while in 
             the kitchen, Attila's Kitchen is not responsible for any damage or injury 
             during the cooking process.</p>
             <br>
             <ul>
              <li>Do not put cooked food on an unwashed plate or a cutting board <br> 
                that has had raw food on it. Always put cooked food on a clean plate.</li>
                <li>Use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose for sneezes or coughs, <br>
                  and turn away from food while coughing or sneezing. Wash hands right<br>
                  away after a cough or sneeze.</li>
                  <li>Turn the oven off and unplug all cooking appliances before leaving <br>
                    the kitchen. Never leave an oven or stove on or with the door open <br>
                    for room heat.</li>
                    <li>Keep electrical appliances away from water to avoid shocks. Stay away<br>
                      from electrical sockets, especially if your hands are wet, and instruct<br>
                      children not to put their fingers or hands anywhere near sockets.</li>
                      <li>Always turn pot handles inward toward the back of the stove so they can <br>
                        not be reached or pulled down.</li>
                        <li>Use a frying screen over pans to prevent grease splattering. If grease<br>
                          catches fire, cover the pan with a lid.</li>
                          <li>Never add water to a pan that has hot oil in it. It could make the <br>
                            oil spatter and burn someone. Throw baking soda or flour on a grease fire</li>
